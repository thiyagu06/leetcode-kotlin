LeetCode Solutions
==================

LeetCode solutions in Kotlin, and a few in Java (for problems where Kotlin wasn't supported). All problems have unit tests.

* Problems are in `src/main/kotlin/leetcode` and `src/main/java/leetcode`
    * broken down by difficulty
* the `datastructures` package contains the data types used in LeetCode problems,
    such as `ListNode` & `TreeNode`. 
* `extensions` - Standard Library extensions for common tasks (e.g., producing a map of element to frequency from a list)
* All problems have unit tests
* Kotlin version 1.3.x
* Gradle build & wrapper
